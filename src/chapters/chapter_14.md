### Chapter 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

**C****ommitment Device:** a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future

For example:

- Overeating? Purchase food in individual packages instead of bulk size
- Want to get in shape? Schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time

Commitment devices are useful because they **take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation**. They increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present.

The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to **automate your future habits**. Onetime choices – like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan – deliver increasing returns over time. 

Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.

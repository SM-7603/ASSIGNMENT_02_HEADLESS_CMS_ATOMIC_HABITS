### **Chapter** 19 The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.

**The Goldilocks Rule:** _“Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities._ _Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.”_

**The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.** As habits become routine, they become less interesting and satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to **keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.** 

> _“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else? At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”_

**Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.**

When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.

The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to **fall in love with boredom**.

## The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

### Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

You don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. With enough practice, **your brain will pick up on the cues** that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, **we stop paying attention to what we are doing.**

That’s why the process of behavior change always starts with **awareness**. You need to be **aware of your habits before you can change them.**

We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the **Habits Scorecard**, which is a simple exercise you can use to **become more aware of your behavior.**

**How to create your Habit Scorecard:**

1. Make a list of your daily habits
2. For each habit, ask yourself: _“Is this a good, habit, or neutral habit?”_
3. If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. For bad habits, write “–”. For neutral, write “=”

If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: _“Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?”_

Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

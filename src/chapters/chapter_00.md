## Executive Summary

The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1% improvement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of **atomic habits stacking up**, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system.

**Awareness comes before desire.**

A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. It can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.

With a **big enough why you can overcome any how**. If your motivation and desire are great enough, you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action – even when friction is high.

Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. To do anything, you must **first cultivate a desire for it**.

Appealing to **emotion** is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive and not necessarily in what is logical.

Suffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The **desire to change** your state is what powers you to take action.

**Your** **actions reveal your true motivations.**

**Our expectations determine our satisfaction.** If the gap between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.

Feelings come both **before and after the behavior.** The craving (a feeling) motivates you to act. The reward teaches you to repeat the action in the future:

Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)

How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel. Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains. Wanting and liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it.

**Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior.** Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.

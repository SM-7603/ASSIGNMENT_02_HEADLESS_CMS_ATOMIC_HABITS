### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become **automatic**. Their ultimate purpose is solving problems as little energy and effort as possible.

Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop of four steps:

1. **Cue:** what triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. The bit of information that predicts a reward
2. **Craving:** the motivational force behind every habit. You donâ€™t crave the habit itself, but the change in state it delivers (e.g. you do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides)
3. **Response:** the actual habit you perform, as a thought or action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and the amount of friction associated with the behavior
4. **Reward:** the end goal of every habit. We chase rewards because they satisfy our cravings and teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. **Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.**

The **Four Laws of Behavior Change** are a simple set of rules we can use to **build better habits**:

1. **Cue:** make it obvious
2. **Craving:** make it attractive
3. **Response:** make it easy
4. **Reward:** make it satisfying

We can invert these laws to learn **how to break a bad habit**:

1. **Cue:** make it invisible
2. **Craving:** make it unattractive
3. **Response:** make it difficult
4. **Reward:** make it unsatisfying

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

**The Three Layers of Behavior Change:**

1. **Outcomes:** changing your results, e.g. losing weight. Most of the goals you set are at this level
2. **Process:** changing your habits and systems, e.g. developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build live at this level
3. **Identity:** changing your beliefs, e.g. your worldview or self-image. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level

The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on **who you wish to become**.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. **True behavior change is identity change.** 

> _“The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.”_

**Your identity emerges out of your habits.** Repeating a behavior reinforces the identity associated with it.

Every action is a **vote for the type of person you wish to become**.

> _“Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.”_

New identities require new evidence. **If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had**. 

**How to change your identity:**

1. **Decide the type of person you want to be:** What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become? Now ask yourself: _“Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”_ For example, the type of person who could write a book is probably consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based)
2. **Prove it to yourself with small wins:** once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity

> _“I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.”_

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to **continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity**.

The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because **they can change your beliefs about yourself**.

Quite literally, you become your habits.

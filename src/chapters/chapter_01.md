### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

A habit is a behavior performed regularly and, in many cases, automatically.

**Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.**

Success is the product of [daily habits](https://dansilvestre.com/good-daily-habits/). Getting **1% better every day** counts for a lot in the long-run. 

The important thing is whether your habits are putting you on the right path. **Be concerned with your current trajectory and not with your current results.**

> _“Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits._ **_You get what you repeat.”_**

If you want better results, forget about setting goals. **Focus on your system instead.**

**Goals vs Systems**

- Goals are the results you want to achieve. Systems are the processes that lead to those results
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress
- Achieving a goal is a momentary change. Systems solve a problem for good
- Goals restrict happiness, e.g. _“Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.”_ Systems make you fall in love with the process rather than the product so you don’t have to wait to permit yourself to be happy
- Goals are at odds with long-term progress. Goals are about winning the game. Systems are about continuing to play the game

You do not rise to the level of your goals. **You fall to the level of your systems.**

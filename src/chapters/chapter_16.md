### Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

One of the most satisfying feelings is **the feeling of making progress.**

A **habit tracker** is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. **[Don’t break the chain](https://dansilvestre.com/productivity-calculator/).**

Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.

Whenever possible, **automate measurement**. Limit manual tracking to your most important habits. Record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. 

The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: **“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].”**

For example:

- After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout journal
- After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate

Try to keep your habit streak alive. 

Life will interrupt you at some point. Remind yourself of a simple rule: **never miss twice**. If you miss one day, try to **get back on track as quickly as possible**. 

Show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. Doing something – ten squats or one push-up – is huge. Don’t put up a zero. **Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.**

Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system. **Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.**

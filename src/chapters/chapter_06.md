### Chapter 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

**Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.** Habits are context-dependent. Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. 

Make the [cues of good habits](https://dansilvestre.com/make-better-decisions/) **[obvious](https://dansilvestre.com/make-better-decisions/)** [in your environment](https://dansilvestre.com/make-better-decisions/):

- Practice guitar more frequently? Place it in the middle of the living room
- Drink more water? Fill up a few water bottles each morning and place them around the house

The most persistent behaviors usually have **multiple cues**. Habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. **The context becomes the cue**.

It is **easier to build new habits in a new environment** as you won’t fight old cues. Create new routines in new places, like a different coffee shop or a bench in the park.

If you can’t, rearrange your current one. Create a **separate space** for work, study, exercise, and entertainment. 

If your space is limited, [divide your room into](https://dansilvestre.com/productivity-spaces/) **[activity zones](https://dansilvestre.com/productivity-spaces/)**: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces.

> _“I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.”_

A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.

## Advanced Tactics: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great

### Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent (*When Genes Matter and When They Don’t*)

To maximize your odds of success, **choose the right field of competition**.

Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. 

**Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities.**

**Choose the habits that best suit you**, not the most popular. Find the version of the habit that brings you satisfaction.

**Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.** 

At the beginning of a new activity, you want to explore. In relationships, it’s called dating. You want to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.

Then, shift focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing.

**If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.**

In the long-run, work on the strategy that delivers the best results about 80 to 90% of the time and keep exploring the remaining 10 to 20% (as per the [80/20 rule](https://dansilvestre.com/80-20-rule/)).

To narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you, ask yourself as you explore: 

- What feels like fun to me, but work to others?
- Where do I get greater returns than the average person?
- What comes naturally to me?

**Play a game that favors your strengths.** 

And if you can’t find a game that favors you, **create one**. Rewrite the rules. When you can’t win by being better, **win by being different**. 

**A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.**

Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. **They clarify it.** Once you realize your strengths, you know where to spend your time and energy.

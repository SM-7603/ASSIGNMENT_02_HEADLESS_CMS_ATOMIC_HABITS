## The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

### Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. 

Habits are a **dopamine-driven feedback loop**. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming – taking drugs, eating junk food, browsing social media – is associated with higher levels of dopamine. Dopamine is released when you experience pleasure but also when you _anticipate_ it.

It is the **anticipation of a reward** – not the fulfillment of it – that **gets us to take action**.

> _“Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.”_

The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

**Temptation Bundling:** pair an action you _want_ to do with an action you _need_ to do

For example:

- Only listen to podcasts you love while exercising
- Only watch your favorite show while ironing 

**How to build your temptation bundling strategy:**

1. In the first column, write the pleasures you enjoy and the temptations that you want to do
2. In the second column, write the tasks you should be doing but often procrastinate on
3. Browse your list and link one of your instantly gratifying “_want_” behaviors with something you “_should_” be doing

You can combine temptation bundling with habit stacking:  **“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].”**

For example:

- You want to read the news but need to express more gratitude: _“After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for that happened yesterday (need). After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).”_
- You want to check Facebook but need to exercise more: _“After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need). After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).”_

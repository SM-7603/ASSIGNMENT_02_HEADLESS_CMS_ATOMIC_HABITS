### Chapter 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt **habits that are praised and approved of by our culture** because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.

We tend to **imitate** the habits of three social groups. Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive:

1. **Imitating the Close:** we pick up habits from the people around us. To build better habits, join a culture where **your desired behavior is normal behavior**. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit
2. **Imitating the Many:** whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior.  Most days, **we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves**
3. **Imitation the Powerful:** we are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. If **a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise**, we find it attractive. We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status

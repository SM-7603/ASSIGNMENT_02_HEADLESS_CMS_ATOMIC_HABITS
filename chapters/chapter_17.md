## Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying

### Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

Behavior is avoided when the experience is painful or unsatisfying. Pain is an effective teacher. **The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior.**

To prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, **add an instant cost** to the action to reduce their odds. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences. As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to change.

**Habit Contract:** a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Find accountability partners that sign off on the contract with you

An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself but also **failing to uphold your promises to others**.

A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.

## Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible

### Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control

Once a habit has been formed, the urge to act follows **whenever the environmental cues reappear.** 

Bad habits are autocatalytic: **the process feeds itself**. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food.

Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.

**You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.** 

In the short-run, you can try to overpower temptation. In the long-run, you **become a product of the environment** that you live in. 

> _“I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.”_

The best strategy to eliminate bad habits is to cut off at the source. **Reduce exposure to the cue** that causes it.

For example:

- Can’t get any work done? Leave your phone in another room for a few hours
- Watch too much television? Move the TV out of the bedroom

Rather than make it obvious, make it invisible. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away. **Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.**

People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.

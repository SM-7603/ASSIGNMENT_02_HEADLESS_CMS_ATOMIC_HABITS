### Chapter 12: The Law of Least Effort

Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We naturally gravitate toward the option that requires **the least amount of work**.

So it is crucial to make your habits so easy that **you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it**. 

Create [an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible](https://dansilvestre.com/make-better-decisions/). 

Rather than trying to overcome friction, **reduce the friction associated with good behaviors.** When friction is low, habits are easy. 

Optimize your environment to make actions easier. To practice a new habit, choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. 

Another way is to prime your environment to [make future actions easier](https://dansilvestre.com/improve-focus/). 

For example:

- Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle ahead of time
- Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables and pack them in containers so you have easy access to healthy snacks

To break bad habits, **[increase the friction](https://dansilvestre.com/quit-bad-habits/)** **[associated with bad behaviors](https://dansilvestre.com/quit-bad-habits/).** When friction is high, habits are difficult. 

For example:

- Watch too much television? Take the batteries out of the remote after each use so it takes an extra ten seconds to turn it back on
- Check your phone too much? Leave it in another room so you must get up to check it

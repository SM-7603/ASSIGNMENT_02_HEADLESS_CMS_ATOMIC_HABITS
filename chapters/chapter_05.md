### Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

The two most common cues that can trigger a habit are **time** and **location**. 

**Implementation Intention:** pairing a new habit with a specific time and location –  **“I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”**

For example: “I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. at my local gym.”

**Habit Stacking:** pairing a new habit with a current habit – **“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**

For example: “After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.”

The key is to **tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day**. 

You can develop **general habit stacks** for specific situations:

- “If I see stairs, I will take them instead of the elevator.”
- “When I serve myself, I will always put veggies on my plate first.”

The secret to creating a successful habit stack is **selecting the right cue**. Brainstorm a list of your current habits:

1. In the first column, write the habits you do each day without fail
2. In the second column, write everything that happens to you each day without fail
3. Now find the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle

Make your cue **highly specific and immediately actionable**: “After I close the door”; “After I brush my teeth”. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.

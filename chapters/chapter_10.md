## Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive

### Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

Every behavior has a **surface level craving** and a **deeper underlying motive**.

We do not desire to smoke cigarettes or check Instagram. At a deep level, we simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, win social acceptance and approval, or achieve status. 

**Our habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires**. Some reduce stress by smoking a cigarette while others go for a run.

Once you **associate a solution with the problem** you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. 

For example:

- Cue: You notice that the stove is hot. Prediction: “If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.”
- Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green. Prediction: “If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection, so I should step on the gas.”

**Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive**.

The cause of your habits is actually **the prediction that precedes them**. The prediction leads to a feeling, which is how we normally describe a craving – a feeling, a desire, an urge. 

Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.

To reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits, **make them more attractive by learning to associate them with a positive experience**. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

For example:

- **Exercise.** Exercise can be associated with a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can view it as a way to develop skills and strength. Instead of _“I need to go run in the morning,”_ say _“It’s time to build endurance and get fast”_
- **Finance.** Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. You can associate it with freedom as living below your current means increases your future means

Create a motivation ritual by **doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit**.

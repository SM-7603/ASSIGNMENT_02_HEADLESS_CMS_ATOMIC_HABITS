<h3>Chapter 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward</h3>
<p>We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that <strong>we never get around to taking action.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Motion</em>: outlining twenty ideas for articles. <em>Action</em>: sitting down and writing an article</li>
<li><em>Motion</em>: search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic. <em>Action</em>: eat a healthy meal</li>
</ul>
<p>Motion can be useful, but <strong>it will never produce an outcome by itself</strong>.</p>
<p>Motion feels like making progress without running the risk of failure. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done.</p>
<p>The most <strong>effective form of learning is practice</strong>, not planning. <strong>Focus on taking action, not being in motion.</strong></p>
<p>To master a habit, start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. Just practice it. <strong>Get your reps in.</strong></p>
<p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.</p>

<p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as <strong>the number of times you have performed it</strong>. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. It’s the <strong>frequency</strong> that makes the difference.</p>

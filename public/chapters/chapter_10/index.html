<h3>Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits</h3>
<p>Every behavior has a <strong>surface level craving</strong> and a <strong>deeper underlying motive</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not desire to smoke cigarettes or check Instagram. At a deep level, we simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, win social acceptance and approval, or achieve status.</p>
<p><strong>Our habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires</strong>. Some reduce stress by smoking a cigarette while others go for a run.</p>
<p>Once you <strong>associate a solution with the problem</strong> you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cue: You notice that the stove is hot. Prediction: “If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.”</li>
<li>Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green. Prediction: “If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection, so I should step on the gas.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive</strong>.</p>
<p>The cause of your habits is actually <strong>the prediction that precedes them</strong>. The prediction leads to a feeling, which is how we normally describe a craving – a feeling, a desire, an urge.</p>
<p>Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.</p>
<p>To reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits, <strong>make them more attractive by learning to associate them with a positive experience</strong>. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Exercise can be associated with a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can view it as a way to develop skills and strength. Instead of <em>“I need to go run in the morning,”</em> say <em>“It’s time to build endurance and get fast”</em></li>
<li><strong>Finance.</strong> Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. You can associate it with freedom as living below your current means increases your future means</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a motivation ritual by <strong>doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit</strong>.</p>

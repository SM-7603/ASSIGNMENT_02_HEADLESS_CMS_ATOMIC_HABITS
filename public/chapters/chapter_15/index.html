<h3>Chapter 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change</h3>
<p>Behavior is repeated when the experience is satisfying. For habits to stick, you need to feel <strong>immediately successful – even if it’s in a small way</strong>.</p>
<p>Habits produce outcomes across time that are often misaligned. <strong>The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:</strong> <em>“What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.”</em></p>
<p>Add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p>
<p>In the beginning, make the ending of your habit satisfying so you stay on track. Use reinforcement with an immediate reward to increase the rate of the behavior.</p>
<p>Select <strong>short-term rewards that reinforce your identity</strong> rather than ones that conflict with it.</p>
<p>For example, rewarding exercise with ice cream is conflicting. Maybe reward yourself with a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body.</p>
<p>You can also <strong>make avoidance visible</strong>. Open a savings account for something you want – like a “Leather Jacket”. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the jacket feels better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to do nothing.</p>
<p>Eventually, intrinsic rewards (better mood, more energy, etc.) kick in and you’ll be less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. You do it because it’s who you are. <strong>Identity sustains a habit.</strong></p>

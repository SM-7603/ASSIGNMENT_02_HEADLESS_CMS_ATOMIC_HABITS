                <article><h3>Chapter 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule</h3>
<p>Habits can be completed in a few seconds but <strong>continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.</strong> It’s easier to continue what you are doing than start something different.</p>
<p>Many habits occur at decisive moments – choices that are like a fork in the road – and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.</p>
<p>It’s easy to start too big. Excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. To counteract it, use the <strong>Two-Minute Rule</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scale down habits into a two-minute version:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>Read before bed each night</em>” becomes “<em>Read one page</em>”</li>
<li>“<em>Do thirty minutes of yoga</em>” becomes “<em>Take out my yoga mat</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to <strong>make your habits as easy as possible to start</strong>. The actions that follow a new habit can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. You need a <strong>“gateway habit”.</strong></p>
<p>Find gateway habits that lead to your desired outcome by mapping your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.”</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running a marathon – very hard</li>
<li>Running a 5K – hard</li>
<li>Walking ten thousand steps – moderately difficult</li>
<li>Walking ten minutes – easy</li>
<li>Putting on your running shoes – very easy</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes.</p>
<p>The point is to master the habit of showing up. <strong>You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.</strong> Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.</p>
<p>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. <strong>Standardize before you optimize.</strong></p>
<p>The rule also reinforces the identity you want to build. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be. One minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.</p>
<p>Once you’ve mastered showing up, <strong>scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal with habit shaping</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to become an early rise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be home by 10 p.m. every night</li>
<li>Have all devices turned off by 10 p.m. every night</li>
<li>Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night</li>
<li>Lights off by 10 p.m. every night</li>
<li>Wake up at 6 a.m. every day</li>
</ol>

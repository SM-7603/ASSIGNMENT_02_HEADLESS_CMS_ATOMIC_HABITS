                <article><h4>Chapter 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits</h4>
<p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that <strong>we stop paying attention to little errors and feedback.</strong></p>
<p>Habits alone aren’t sufficient for mastery. You need a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice:</p>
<p><strong>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</strong></p>
<p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Each habit unlocks <strong>the next level of performance</strong>. It’s an endless cycle.</p>
<p>You must remain conscious of your performance over time so you can continue to refine and improve. Establish a system for reflection and review to ensure that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annual Review</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each December, reflect on the previous year. Tally your habits and reflect on your progress by answering three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What went well this year?</em></li>
<li><em>What didn’t go so well this year?</em></li>
<li><em>What did I learn?</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrity Report</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Six months later, conduct a different review. Revisit your core values and question if you have been living in accordance with them. Answer three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What are the core values that drive my life and work?</em></li>
<li><em>How am I living and working with integrity right now?</em></li>
<li><em>How can I set a higher standard in the future?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection and review is also the ideal time to <strong>revisit your identity</strong>.</p>
<p>In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.</p>
<p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the <strong>harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</strong> Avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are.</p>
<p>Redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m an athlete”</em> becomes <em>“I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m the CEO”</em> translates to <em>“I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When chosen effectively, <strong>your identity works with the changing circumstances</strong> rather than against them.</p>

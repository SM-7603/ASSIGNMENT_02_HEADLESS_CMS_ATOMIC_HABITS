<h3>Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent (<em>When Genes Matter and When They Don’t</em>)</h3>
<p>To maximize your odds of success, <strong>choose the right field of competition</strong>.</p>
<p>Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choose the habits that best suit you</strong>, not the most popular. Find the version of the habit that brings you satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of a new activity, you want to explore. In relationships, it’s called dating. You want to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.</p>
<p>Then, shift focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing.</p>
<p><strong>If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.</strong></p>
<p>In the long-run, work on the strategy that delivers the best results about 80 to 90% of the time and keep exploring the remaining 10 to 20% (as per the <a href="https://dansilvestre.com/80-20-rule/">80/20 rule</a>).</p>
<p>To narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you, ask yourself as you explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</li>
<li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</li>
<li>What comes naturally to me?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play a game that favors your strengths.</strong></p>
<p>And if you can’t find a game that favors you, <strong>create one</strong>. Rewrite the rules. When you can’t win by being better, <strong>win by being different</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.</strong></p>
<p>Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. <strong>They clarify it.</strong> Once you realize your strengths, you know where to spend your time and energy.</p>
